# S.Craps

Just roll the dice!
This will eventually be an OS with craps programmed into the shell.
Maybe not craps but dice digit random number generators?
Depends on the size of the program.
How small is lite and portable?
is 512MB to small?
There are already OS's out there that does it.
But I like my idea
Lite Portable Perfect for S.C. Devices
Roll the Dice on this Device.

Craps might to too hard a word, if i call it Shell.C it may sound a little better.
