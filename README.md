# Shell.C

Just roll the dice!

This will eventually be an OS with craps programmed into the shell.
Maybe not craps but dice digit random number generators?
Depends on the size of the program.
How small is lite and portable?
is 512MB too small?
There are already OS's out there that does it.
But I like my idea

Lite Portable Perfect for S.Craps Devices

Roll the Dice on this Device.

Craps might to too harsh a word, if I call it Shell.C it may sound softer on the ears.

"Shell.C or S.Craps, a little shell with a load of crap."

"it's written in C"

"what's the point of the craps games?

"you dont need it, it's just there."

"Who came up with is shit?"
